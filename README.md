## Secrets & Release Preparation

- **local.properties**: This file contains sensitive data (e.g., Google client ID) and must NOT be committed. Use the provided template and add your own secrets locally.
- **Keystore files**: Never commit your release keystore or passwords. Use local signing configs only.
- **google-services.json**: If present, do not commit real credentials. Use a placeholder for open source or share securely with collaborators.
- **ProGuard**: Rules are included, but do not add secrets to proguard-rules.pro.

### Setting up for Development
1. Copy `local.properties.example` (or the template in this repo) to `local.properties`.
2. Add your real Google client ID and SDK path.
3. Never commit your `local.properties` or keystore files.

### Preparing for Release
- Double-check that no secrets are hardcoded in the codebase.
- Ensure all sensitive files are in `.gitignore`.
- Build with ProGuard enabled for release.
